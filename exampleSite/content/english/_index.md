    plastic wastes into eco-friendly products using the 3R ( Reduce, Reuse, Recycle)
    to save our planet Earth by weaving them into innovative items. '
  content: |
    With the vision of creating a sustainable world without textile and plastic wastes, it became necessary for us at Planet 3R to reduce the landfill space by recycling clothes and nylons. As we know landfill sites is a threat to our environment as well as water supplies.

    In my quest to creating more impact, I realized many people in my community usually dump textile and plastic wastes by the road side while some even go to the extent of burning them thereby depleting the ozone layer which is hazardous to our health and environment thus prompted me to use my weaving skills at Jokelinks to create an innovative solution by starting planet 3R initiative.

    We have been able to bridge the gap by providing solutions to the problems other existing solutions were not looking into.

  title: CONVERTING TEXTILE AND PLASTIC WASTES INTO ECO-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS
  content: |
    Dumping of wastes on the roadside and inside drainage channels especially single use plastics are currently one of the biggest environmental concerns. It causes groundwater pollution, marine pollution resulting in animal deaths and the many other adverse effects on the environment.

    Our initiative focuses on the empowerment of unemployed youths by training them on effective ways to earn income from recycling plastic and textile waste.  We weave the wastes into eco-friendly products. We also engage in Grassroots and Creative Awareness programs geared Towards Achieving a Clean Environment.

    Our competitive advantage is the fact that we recycle used nylons with locally made loom while creative hub, pearl recycling make use of plastics and foreign machinery.

    We creatively shred old clothes and used nylons (especially pure water sachets) then weave them by converting into finished products. These finished products are fashion wears, home decors, bags, accessories etc.

    At Planet 3R, we not only make environmental impacts but also create employment opportunity by empowering youths. We also plan to improve our economy through locally generated raw materials and export opportunities
