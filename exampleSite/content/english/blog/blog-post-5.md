Planet 3R is a social enterprise dedicated to converting textile and plastic wastes into eco-friendly products using the 3R ( Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to save our planet Earth by weaving them into innovative items. With the vision of creating a sustainable world without textile and plastic wastes, it became necessary for us at Planet 3R to reduce the landfill space by recycling clothes and nylons. As we know landfill sites is a threat to our environment as well as water supplies.

In my quest to creating more impact, I realized many people in my community usually dump textile and plastic wastes by the road side while some even go to the extent of burning them thereby depleting the ozone layer which is hazardous to our health and environment thus prompted me to use my weaving skills at Jokelinks to create an innovative solution by starting planet 3R initiative.

Global Creative market is worth $1.3 trillion. African Creative Industry is worth over $4.2 billion. With over 500million Africans in Diaspora and more than 30million tourists, we are targeting 2% of total Africa market.

We have been able to bridge the gap by providing solutions to the problems other existing solutions were not looking into.
